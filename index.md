## Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Documentation
Hello! Welcome to my unofficial documentation site! It is a remake of my old site, http://pe.thediamondyt.tk.

This is primarily a developer focused site, so it may be slightly hard to understand for non-developers.  

The site is also open source, check it out @ [Github](https://github.com/lukeeey/mcpe-docs)

(i will make this look prettier in the future)  

### [REST Api](rest-api/)  
### [Minecraft Url Scheme](url-scheme/)  
### [Protocol](protocol/)
